# About the challenge

In this challenge, you will develop an application to manage a shopping cart for a fictional caf√©. The application will have the following features:

- Listing of products (coffees) available for purchase.
- Adding a specific quantity of items to the cart.
- Increasing or decreasing the quantity of items in the cart.
- A form for the user to fill out their address.
- Displaying the total number of items in the cart in the Header.
- Displaying the total value of the items in the cart, calculated by multiplying the quantity by the price.

For this application, we provide a layout for you to follow and implement all the functionalities designed in Figma. You can access the layout here:

Concepts Practiced:

- States: Managing application state.
- ContextAPI: Using React Context API for state management.
- LocalStorage: Storing data in the browser's localStorage.
- Immutability of state: Ensuring that state is not mutated directly but updated immutably.
- Lists and keys in ReactJS: Rendering lists of items and using keys to uniquely identify them.
- Props: Passing data and behavior between components through props.
- Componentization: Breaking the UI into reusable and modular components for better maintainability and reusability.
